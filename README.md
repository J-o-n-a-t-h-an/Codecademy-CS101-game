# MadLibs

I created this game for the Codecademy CS101 Final Project.

The game asks you to select a MadLib and then prompts for all the necessary words.

Most of the MadLibs were taken from the [MadLibs printable website](https://www.madlibs.com/printables/) but one of them was created by myself.

## Future ideas
- Implement a solution for MadLib selection that uses more robust tools instead of working through an IF statement but for now the current option works.
- Implement a solution to ask for all the related word choices at once instead of prompting for each blank space.
- Impletment an option to export to text or maybe share with social media just so i learn how to do that stuff.
