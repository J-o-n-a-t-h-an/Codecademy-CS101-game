# Dice Men!

This is my first game.  Its based on James Ernst' game called [Button Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Button_Men)

This is a project for Codecademy's CS101 project.

# MadLibs!

This is my alternate idea and the one i might do first.  I'm thinking the dice men might be too difficult for me.  I originally thought that madlibs would be too easy but maybe i'm giving myself too much credit.  Plus i think i can make it more difficult by including classes and giving the user choices.
