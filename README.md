# Dice Men!

This is my first game.  Its based on James Ernst' game called [Button Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Button_Men)

This is a project for Codecademy's CS101 project.

# MadLibs!

This is my alternate idea and the one i might do first.  I'm thinking the dice men might be too difficult for me.  I originally thought that madlibs would be too easy but maybe i'm giving myself too much credit.  Plus i think i can make it more difficult by including classes and giving the user choices.

ToDo:
- I need to figure out how to turn the mad libs into a class so that the user can pick which mad libs to do.
- Maybe add a feature to save it to a text file.
- Let user review words and edit them before generating the madlib.
